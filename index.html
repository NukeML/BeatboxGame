      <p>
        Thank you for checking out our prototype!<br><br>
        We are working on an AI beatbox coach tailored for those who are just starting to learn beatboxing.<br><br>
        With this game, we aim to collect sound data to see how well the average person can imitate a professional's beatboxing.<br><br>
        If you already have some beatboxing skill/experience and would like to learn more about what we're working on, please contact Aaron Lee on <br>
        beatml.webcontact@gmail.com<br>
        for something more exciting than this game!

    <div class="audio-player-container">
      <p>
        In the next page, there is a short beatboxing clip recorded by a professional for you to mimic.<br><br>
        Ideally, you should be in a quiet area with little to no background noise.<br><br>
        As soon as you click Next Page, your browser will ask for microphone permissions.<br>
        Please click "allow" to be able to record your attempt at imitating the beatboxing!<br><br>
        After you record, there will be a preview of your recording that you can listen back to,<br>
        and a Submit button to submit your recording.<br><br>
        Only if you click Submit will we receive the exact sound data as in the preview.<br><br>
        By clicking Next Page below, you consent to us collecting the sound data that you will have previewed before submitting,<br>
        and you confirm that you have no prior beatboxing experience.
